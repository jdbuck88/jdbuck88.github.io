                <h2>Scotland is home to about 150 distilleries and only 10-15 of them make peated scotch, or scotch that is smoky in flavor.</h2>
                <h2>The island famous for making the smokiest scotches is the Isle of Islay... which is what we are focusing on here.</h2>
                <h3>The whisky gets the smoky flavor from drying the barley over a peat fire before being milled, mashed, and distilled.</h3><br>

                <h2>Glassware is important.</h2>  
                    <p>Ideally, use a Glencairn, a Norlan, or a tulip whisky glass when drinking scotch neat.  Pour about 30 mL in a glass.</p>

                        <h2>Take your time.</h2>  
                    <p>Don't shoot the whisky.  Wait to smell the scotch if possible.</p>
                    <p>Take a small amount into your mouth and hold it there for a moment or two while breathing through your nose.</p>
                    <p>Roll it around on your tongue and swallow.</p>  
                <h2><em>Breathe.</em></h2>
                <h2>Now that you have acclimated... Take a smell.</h2>
                    <p>Can you smell the smoke? The wood? Perhaps vanilla or raisins?</p>  
                    <p>Each smell will come from the process of making the whisky or the maturation in the wood for years.<p><br>

                        <h2>Finally... it's time to taste the whisky.</h2> 
                    <p>Focus on how it feels.  Is it soft or aggressive? Oily or thin?</p>
                    <p>Since this is an Islay Scotch, can you taste the smoke?  Is it subtle or pronounced?</p>
                    <p>Next, try to determine if it is sweet, salty, and/or astringent.  Does it feel like wine tannins on the finish or is it more velvety?</p><br>
                <h2>There are many flavors that can be found in scotch... but don't focus too much on that if you are new to this.</h2>
                <h2>Here's what that looks like if you are curious...</h2>

                <h1>A little about the magical island of Islay</h1>
                    <p>Islay is the southernmost island of the Inland Hebrides,located off the west coast of Scotland, and is known as "Queen of the Hebrides" (Banrìgh nan Eilean).</p> 
                    <p>It has a total area of 600 km², with just over 3,000 inhabitants, and as many as nine different active distilleries for whisky production.</p>
                    <p>Accessible only by a 2.5 hour Ferry or tiny prop plane out of Glasgow, and both of those completely dependant on unreliable weather, Islay is relatively hard to get to.</p>
